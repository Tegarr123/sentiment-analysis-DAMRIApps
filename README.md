## üìí Notebook Description
### 01_DAMRI_Apps_Scrapping.ipynb
Notebook for scraping DAMRI Apps reviews from the Google Play Store (Indonesian language only). This step collects raw review data with ```google_play_scraper``` library, and the extracts following feature.
- ```content```
- ```score```
- ```thumbsUpCount```
- ```reviewCreatedVersion```
- ```at```
- ```replyContent```
-  ```repliedAt```
### 02_DAMRI_Apps_Preprocessing.ipynb
Notebook for preprocessing reviews with the following techniques:
- Emoji removal
- Punctuation removal
- Case lowering (normalization to lowercase)
- Tokenization
- Stemming
- Stopwords removal
- Expand contraction (handling shortened words/phrases)
### 03_DAMRI_Apps_RegEx.ipynb
Notebook for advanced preprocessing using regular expressions (RegEx) to handle specific text-cleaning scenarios that cannot be addressed through simple preprocessing steps.
### 04_DAMRI_Apps_BoW.ipynb
Notebook for implementing Bag of Words (BoW) representation of the cleaned text. This provides a baseline text representation method for further analysis.
### 05_DAMRI_Apps_EDA.ipynb
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the preprocessed dataset to uncover insights such as:
- Score distribution
- Number of Reviews per year
- Common positive and negative terms
- Sentiment trends across reviews
### 06_DAMRI_Apps_TF-IDF.ipynb
Notebook for TF-IDF vectorization and sentiment classification using multiple machine learning models:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
This stage evaluates the performance of various algorithms to determine the most effective model for sentiment analysis on DAMRI Apps reviews.
